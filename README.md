## R7. Identification of the problem solved by building this particular marketplace app.

D'Artiste ("Digital Artist" with Artiste spelt the French way with an "e") is a marketplace application created for paint artists, digital artists and graphic designers of all genres to showcase and sell their artwork to art lovers. The purpose of D'Artiste is to allow artists to sell their art without the hassle of printing and posting. By removing the print side of purchasing art, this also reduces the cost of purchasing artworks as the buyer would simply be able to download a high quality print file with a maximum print size specified by the artist (e.g 100 x 150 cms) which they can then use to print with their local printer on a finishing and frame of their choice (e.g canvas print, giclee prints, hahnemuhle etching paper prints, watercolour prints etc...)


## R8. Why is it a problem that needs solving?

In today's modern society artists varying from paint artists, digital artists to graphic designers are in constant competition with the big chain stores such as Kmart, Target, Big-W, Spotlight (etc...) who sell a variety of low cost interior designs, including artworks, therefore leaving little to no room for competition for today's struggling artists. D'Artiste intends to pave the way and create a love for quality and unique art by allowing new and uprising artists to showcase their talents and to make a mark in the digital world. D'Artiste aims at building a community of art lovers who appreciate uniqueness and creativity.

## R11. Description of marketplace application, including:

### Purpose

D'Artiste is a two way marketplace application built for artists to show case and sell their digital artworks to art lovers. The purpose of the application is for art lovers to be able to purchase unique and creative digital art at a reduced cost. In order for the costs to be lower than artworks available on other platforms an artist simply sells their digital artwork as a high quality print file with an optimised maximum print size (e.g 100 x 150 cm) without providing printing and framing. The buyer can simply download their purchased artwork file and print with their preferred printer on their choice of print medium and framing. 

D'Artiste is a platform which aims at building a community of artists and art lovers. Artists of the D'Artiste community offer high quality designs at an affordable price.

### Functionality / features

* A Home page is displayed in the root path and greeting users to D'Artiste and prompting them to sign up or view art listing on the "Buy Art" tab. 

* An About page is accessible to the user in the navigation bar which describes the purpose and mission of the application.

* A Contact page is accessible to the user if they wish to contact the site admin.

## R12. Application User Stories

User stories enable us to build a clear understanding of what is expected to achieve for a minimum viable product (MVP) and what we need to focus on to build all features and functions of our application. It is also important to allocate a size and order of importance to each of our User stories to ensure a MVP is delivered on time. To do this a Trello board was established to define the user features of D'Artiste marketplace application. Each feature was allocated a size from small, medium to large (green, orange, red) and a purple tag added for MVP user features. D'Artiste users can be either Artists or Buyers therefore the user stories were listed in three different columns with common user features in the "User Story" column, Artist features in the "Artist Story" column and the Buyer features in the "Buyer Story" Column.

## R15. Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app

* MVP components of D'Artiste:

A user can navigate through the application, view the Home page which prompts the user to join the D'Artiste community and either view art listings or sign up as an artist to sell their art. A user can also view the About page which gives an overview of the applications purpose and mission.

As a marketplace application, D'Artiste enables its users to view artworks listed for sale by other users, each artwork will show a title, artist name, description, size and price. A user can navigate through the main pages of the application "home, about, contact, buy art" without having to sign in or register an account and is able to select and preview artworks they wish to purchase. A user can also proceed to the "checkout" and pay using a credit or debit card (only test mode payment at this stage).

A registered user of the application can log in and view their account through the "My Account" tab which contains a list of their artworks available for sale to other users. In the same tab a registered user can add new artworks to their account and can edit or remove existing artworks. When creating and uploading a new artwork to their account a registered user is prompted to add a title, description, size, price and image to their listing. So to add a personalised touch to the user's experience, when a user is signed in they can view a "Welcome, username" when they visit their account page and the "Buy Art" page.


## R16. Detail any third party services that your app will use

D'Artiste will make use to the following third party services:

* Heroku - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

    * Heroku is used as a deployment platform for D'Artiste marketplace application.
    Heroku is a popular cloud platform which developers use to deploy and manage their applications. Heroku uses Git as its primary means for deploying applications meaning similar commands used with Github are used with Heroku (e.g git push heroku master would push our master branch to the Heroku platform).

* Cloudinary - https://cloudinary.com/

    * Cloudinary is used to store user image uploads on D'Artiste marketplace application.
    Cloudinary is an easy to use cloud-based image and video management platform. Using a cloud based system to store images enables to optimise site performance and user experience with faster page load times.

* Devise gem - https://github.com/heartcombo/devise

    * Devise is a popular gem used with Rails which provides an effective and secure solution to authenticate users. Devise provides all the functionalities and helper methods to allow application users to sign up and log in. Devise can be installed to a Rails application by simply adding it to our Gemfile "gem 'devise", running a bundle install and finalising the installation with the "rails generate devise:install" command line. 

* Rolify gem - https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify

    * Similar to Devise, Rolify is a popular gem used with Rails to authorise user access within an application and assigning roles to specific users. With Rolify we can specify what users can access and what they can view on each page. Within D'Artiste marketplace application, Rolify is used to assign a default role to users when they sign up and then assigns a role "artist" to users who create and save new artwork listings to their account and giving ownership to the user of their artwork.

* Stripe - https://stripe.com/au

    * Stripe is a PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant payment platform which gives online businesses and marketplace applications the ability to accept online credit or debit card payments from their users. D'Artiste marketplace application integrates Stripe as its checkout payment system, although at this stage the payment system in D'Artiste is only available in test mode.

* PostgreSQL - https://www.postgresql.org/

    * PostgreSQL is used as a relational database management system for D'Artiste marketplace. PostgreSQL is Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC) allowing changes to be made to the database without affecting other transactions.

## R20. Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project

Efficient project management enables us to keep track of priorities by breaking down all project tasks needed to ensure we create a product within a certain timeframe and making sure we deliver a minimum viable product (MVP). 

In order to allocate and keep track of tasks during the creation of D'Artiste marketplace application a Trello board was implemented at the start of the project with a list of "To Do" items in order of priority (tagged purple for MVP) and order of size from small, medium to large (green orange, red). A second column "Doing" was added to the Trello board in order to move tasks as they are being completed and a third column "Done" was added to keep track of completed tasks.
